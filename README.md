# realtime_election

A Flutter Web project to distribute election results. The web app is designed based 
on my current University election process but can also be modified to fit other election
processes. 

The web app has 3 users; the Admin, SubAdmins and a user.

1. Admin
The admin is responsible for creating and adding sub admins
The admin creates the election positions, adds the candidates to the various positions
The admin is also responsible for adding election results
The admin can edit and delete a candidate 
The admin is responsible for publishing election reports and notificaions

2. SubAdmin
The sub admin is resposible for adding votes obtained by the candidate.
The sub admin is resposible for updating general election updates like votes cast, counted and spoilt

3. User
The normal user has no resposibility rather than to view election results and report any problems
to the admin
